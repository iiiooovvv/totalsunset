## duressed
When combat begins, all duressed [[models]] on the active site must partipate. A model is considered duressed if 
- an [[opposing model]] has a range weapon and is in [[line of sight]]
- an opposing model has a melee weapon and is in base contact

## Combat Roll
1. Each player rolls a d8 for each under-threat model on the [[active site]]. The result establishes thier weak point. 
2. Then each player rolls a d8 for each model they have duressed. 
3. If the result of one of your rolls matches any [[weak point]] of your opponent's, that [[character]] or [[folk]] takes one ruin and is moved [[off-site]]. If the model is duressed from a [[monster]], they take d8 ruin instead and are moved [[off-site]].
