When you mark your last Ruin—meaning all 6 Ruin boxes are marked—you lose yourself to the wilds that have been growing inside you. You choose whether you become a monster in service to the forces of nature (and the whims of the GM), or whether you simply die. This is an important moment: Everyone focuses on your last actions before you run screaming into the shadows, turn violently against the other characters, or take your final breath.

The GM may allow you to take on a co-GM role, helping describe the terrors of the world—especially any terrors that directly connect to your now-lost character.
